Make your current directory a git repository by running:
git init
Using the SSH link you copied in step 7, add the remote repository as the origin:
git remote add origin git@github.com:yourname/yourrepository.git
Add your files and commits, as you normally would:
git add .
git commit -m "First commit"
Push your changes:
git push -u origin master
